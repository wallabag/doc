# Tagging rules


If you want to automatically assign a tag to new articles, this part of the configuration is for you.

## What does « tagging rules » mean?

They are rules used by wallabag to automatically tag new entries. Each time a new entry is added, all the tagging rules will be used to add the tags you configured, thus saving you the trouble to manually classify your entries.

## How do I use them?

Let assume you want to tag new entries as *« short reading »* when the reading time is inferior to 3 minutes. In that case, you should put « readingTime &lt;= 3 » in the **Rule** field and *« short reading »* in the **Tags** field. Several tags can added simultaneously by separating them by a comma: *« short reading, must read »*. Complex rules can be written by using predefined operators: if *« readingTime &gt;= 5 AND domainName = "github.com" »* then tag as *« long reading, github »*.

## Which variables and operators can I use to write rules?

The following variables and operators can be used to create tagging rules (be careful, for some values, you need to add quotes, for example `language = "en"`):
