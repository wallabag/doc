We'll see here how to interact with the wallabag API.

# Requirements

-   wallabag freshly (or not) installed on <http://localhost:8000>
-   `httpie` installed on your computer ([see project
    website](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie)). Note that you can also adapt the commands using curl or wget.
-   all the API methods are documented here <http://localhost:8000/api/doc> (on your instance) and [on our official instance](http://app.wallabag.it/api/doc)
