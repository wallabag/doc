## Rights access to the folders of the project

### Test environment

When we just want to test wallabag, we just run the command `make run` to start our wallabag instance and everything will go smoothly because the user who started the project can access to the current folder naturally, without any problem.

### Production environment

As soon as we use Apache or Nginx to access to our wallabag instance, and not from the command `make run` to start it, we should take care to grant the good rights on the good folders to keep safe all the folders of the project.

To do so, the folder name, known as `DocumentRoot` (for apache) or `root` (for Nginx), has to be absolutely accessible by the Apache/Nginx user. Its name is generally `www-data`, `apache` or `nobody` (depending on linux system used).

So the folder `/var/www/wallabag/web` has to be accessible by this last one. But this may not be enough if we just care about this folder, because we could meet a blank page or get an error 500 when trying to access to the homepage of the project.

This is due to the fact that we will need to grant the same rights access on the folder `/var/www/wallabag/var` like those we gave on the folder `/var/www/wallabag/web`. Thus, we fix this problem with the following command:

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wallabag/var
```

It has to be the same for the following folders

-   /var/www/wallabag/bin/
-   /var/www/wallabag/app/config/
-   /var/www/wallabag/vendor/
-   /var/www/wallabag/data/

by entering

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wallabag/bin
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wallabag/app/config
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wallabag/vendor
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wallabag/data/
```

otherwise, sooner or later you will see these error messages:

```
Unable to write to the "bin" directory.
file_put_contents(app/config/parameters.yml): failed to open stream: Permission denied
file_put_contents(/.../wallabag/vendor/autoload.php): failed to open stream: Permission denied
```

### Additional rules for SELinux

{% hint style='info' %}
This section may be obsolete.
{% endhint %}

If SELinux is enabled on your system, you will need to configure additional contexts in order for wallabag to function properly. To check if SELinux is enabled, simply enter the following:

`getenforce`

This will return `Enforcing` if SELinux is enabled. Creating a new context involves the following syntax:

`semanage fcontext -a -t <context type> <full path>`

For example:

`semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/var/www/wallabag(/.*)?"`

This will recursively apply the httpd_sys_content_t context to the wallabag directory and all underlying files and folders. The following rules are needed:

| Full path  | Context |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| /var/www/wallabag(/.\*)?  | `httpd_sys_content_t`  |
| /var/www/wallabag/data(/.\*)?  | `httpd_sys_rw_content_t`  |
| /var/www/wallabag/var/logs(/.\*)?  | `httpd_log_t`  |
| /var/www/wallabag/var/cache(/.\*)?  | `httpd_cache_t`  |

After creating these contexts, enter the following in order to apply
your rules:

`restorecon -R -v /var/www/wallabag`

You can check contexts in a directory by typing `ls -lZ` and you can see all of your current rules with `semanage fcontext -l -C`.

If you're installing the preconfigured latest-v2-package, then an additional rule is needed during the initial setup:

`semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/wallabag/var"`

After you successfully access your wallabag and complete the initial setup, this context can be removed:

```bash
    semanage fcontext -d -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/wallabag/var"
    retorecon -R -v /var/www/wallabag/var
```
