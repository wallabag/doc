## Status

Use these checkboxes to find archived or starred articles.

## Preview picture

Check this filter if you want to retrieve articles with a preview
picture.

## Language

wallabag (via graby) can detect an article's language. It's easy for you to
retrieve articles written in a specific language.

## HTTP status

You can retrieve the articles by filtering by their HTTP status code:
200, 404, 500, etc.

## Reading time

wallabag estimates how much time you need to read an article. With this
filter, you can for example find articles with a reading time
between 2 and 5 minutes.

## Domain name

Thanks to this filter, you can retrieve articles from the same
domain name. For example, in this field, type `bbc.co.uk` to retrieve this website's articles.

## Creation date

When you save an article, wallabag stores the current date. You can, for example, retrieve articles written between the 1st and 31st of January.
