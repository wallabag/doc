Configuring mobile apps to work with wallabag
=============================================

Steps to configure the app
--------------------------

-   First *create a new client* in the `API clients management` section. The name of your app doesn't matter as much as the `Client ID` and the `Client secret`. Write these two values down.
-   When you download a mobile app, it's going to ask for the server address of the hosted wallabag instance. For example, with wallabag.it that is: `https://app.wallabag.it`.
-   It's also going to ask for the aforementioned `Client ID` and `secret`. Please insert those in the text fields, when asked.
-   Lastly you need to provide your `username` and `password`. These are the same credentials you use to login in to wallabag.

Please also have a look at [Android](android.html) page. Especially the section on *known limitations*.
