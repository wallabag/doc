# Upgrade your wallabag installation

You will find here different ways to upgrade your wallabag:

-   [from 2.2.x to 2.3.x](#upgrading-from-22x-to-23x)
-   [from 2.x.y to 2.3.x](#upgrading-from-2xy-to-23x)
-   [from 1.x to 2.x](#from-wallabag-1x)

## Upgrading from 2.2.x to 2.3.x

### Upgrade on a dedicated web server

If your current installation is < 2.2.x, please upgrade your instance to 2.2 before.

**From 2.2.x:**

```bash
make update
```

### Upgrade on a shared hosting

Backup your `app/config/parameters.yml` file.

Download the last release of wallabag:

```bash
wget https://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package && tar xvf latest-v2-package
```

You will find the [md5 hash of the latest package on our
website](https://wallabag.org/en#download).

Extract the archive in your wallabag folder and replace
`app/config/parameters.yml` with yours.

Please check that your `app/config/parameters.yml` contains all the
required parameters. You can find [here a documentation about
parameters](./parameters.md).

If you use SQLite, you must also copy your `data/` folder inside the new
installation.

Empty `var/cache` folder.

You must run some SQL queries to upgrade your database. We assume that the table prefix is `wallabag_`. Don't forget to backup your database before migrating.

You may encounter issues with indexes names: if so, please change queries with the correct index name.

[You can find all the queries here](query-upgrade-22-23.md).

### Explanations about database migrations

During the update, we execute database migrations.

All the database migrations are stored in `app/DoctrineMigrations`. You
can execute each migration individually:
`bin/console doctrine:migrations:execute 20161001072726 --env=prod`.

You can also cancel each migration individually:
`bin/console doctrine:migrations:execute 20161001072726 --down --env=prod`.

    Scuttle
