Run wallabag in docker-compose
==============================

This document describes how to use Docker for wallabag development
purposes. For running wallabag in production, please use the
[official docker-compose configuration
provided](https://github.com/wallabag/docker).

To run your own development instance of wallabag, you can use the
pre-configured docker compose files provided in the wallabag repository.

Requirements
------------

Make sure to have
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) and [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) available on your
system and up to date.

Switch DBMS
-----------

By default, wallabag starts with a SQLite database. However, wallabag
also supports PostgreSQL and MySQL. Docker containers are available for both.

In `compose.yaml` (or `docker-compose.yml` for wallabag < 2.7), for the chosen DBMS uncomment:

-   the container definition (`postgres` or `mariadb` root level block)
-   the container link in the `php` container
-   the container env file in the `php` container

In order to keep running Symfony commands on your host (such as
`wallabag:install`), you also should:

-   source the proper env files on your command line, so variables like
    `SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_HOST` will exist.
-   create a `127.0.0.1 rdbms` on your system `hosts` file

Run wallabag
------------

1.  Fork and clone the project
2.  Edit `app/config/parameters.yml` to replace `database_*` properties
    with commented ones (with values prefixed by `env.`)
3.  `composer install` the project dependencies
4.  `php bin/console wallabag:install` to create the schema
5.  `docker compose up` to run the containers (or `docker-compose up` for wallabag < 2.7)
6.  Finally, browse to <http://localhost:8080/> to find your freshly
    installed wallabag.

At various step, you'll probably run into UNIX permission problems, bad
paths in generated cache, etcâ€¦ Operations like removing cache files or
changing files owners might be frequently required, so don't be afraid!
