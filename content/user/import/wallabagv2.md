From the previous wallabag instance on which you were before, go to
All articles, then export these articles as json.

![Export depuis wallabag v2](../../../img/user/export_v2.png)

From your new wallabag instance, create your user account and click on
the link in the menu to proceed to import. Choose import from wallabag
v2 and select your json file to upload it.

If you encounter issues during the export or the import, don't hesitate
to [ask for support](https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag).
