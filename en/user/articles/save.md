# Save articles

The main purpose of wallabag is to save web articles. You have many ways to do it. If you think that the article is wrong displayed, [you can read this documentation](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/errors_during_fetching.html).

## By using a bookmarklet

On the `Howto` page, you have a `Bookmarklet` tab. Drag and drop the `bag it!` link to your bookmarks bar of your browser.

Now, each time you're reading an article on the web and you want to save it, click on the `bag it!` link in your bookmarks bar. The article is saved.

## By using the classic form

In the top bar of your screen, you have 3 icons. With the first one, a plus sign, you can easily save a new article.
