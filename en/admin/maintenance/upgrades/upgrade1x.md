# From wallabag 1.x

There is no automatic script to update from wallabag 1.x to wallabag
2.x. You need to:

* export your data
* install wallabag 2.x ([read the installation documentation](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/installation.html))
* import data in this fresh installation ([read the import documentation](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/import.html) )
