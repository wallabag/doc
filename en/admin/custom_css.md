Custom CSS

{% hint style="tip" %}
Available since 2.4.0 version.
{% endhint %}

You can apply some custom styles to your wallabag instance.

1. Create a file named `custom.css` in the `web/` directory
2. Put whatever CSS you want inside and it'll be automatically loaded on each wallabag page

Keep in mind that this option is instance wide and can't be adjusted per user.
