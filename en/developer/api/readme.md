We'll see here how to interact with the
wallabag API.

# Requirements

-   wallabag freshly (or not) installed on https://app.wallabag.it
-   `httpie` installed on your computer ([see project
    website](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie)). Note that you can also
    adapt the commands using curl or wget.
-   all the API methods are documented here
    https://app.wallabag.it/api/doc (on your instance) and [on our
    example instance](https://app.wallabag.it/api/doc)
