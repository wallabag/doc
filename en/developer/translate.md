# Translate wallabag

## wallabag web application

### Translation files

As wallabag is mainly developed by a French team, please consider that french translation is the most updated one and please copy it to create your own translation.

You can find translation files here: https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/tree/master/src/Wallabag/CoreBundle/Resources/translations.

You have to create `messages.CODE.yml` and `validators.CODE.yml`, where CODE is the ISO 639-1 code of your language ([see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)).

Other files to translate:

-   https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/tree/master/app/Resources/CraueConfigBundle/translations
-   https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/tree/master/src/Wallabag/UserBundle/Resources/translations

You have to create `THE_TRANSLATION_FILE.CODE.yml` files.

### Configuration file

You have to edit [app/config/wallabag.yml](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/blob/master/app/config/wallabag.yml) to display your language on Configuration page of wallabag (to allow users to switch to this new translation).

Under the `wallabag_core.languages` section, you have to add a new line with your translation. For example:

```yaml
wallabag_core:
    ...
    languages:
        en: 'English'
        fr: 'Fran√ßais'
```

For the first column (`en`, `fr`, etc.), you have to add the ISO 639-1 code of your language (see above).

For the second column, it's the name of your language. Just that.

## wallabag documentation

Documentation files are stored here: https://github.com/wallabag/doc/

You need to respect the `en` folder structure when you create your own translation. See also [this page](documentation.md).
