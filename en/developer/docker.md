Run wallabag in docker-compose
==============================

In order to run your own development instance of wallabag, you may want to use the pre-configured docker compose files.

Requirements
------------

Make sure to have
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) availables on your system and up to date.

Switch DBMS
-----------

By default, wallabag will start with a SQLite database. Since wallabag provides support for Postgresql and MySQL, docker containers are also available for these ones.

In `docker-compose.yml`, for the chosen DBMS uncomment:

-   the container definition (`postgres` or `mariadb` root level block)
-   the container link in the `php` container
-   the container env file in the `php` container

In order to keep running Symfony commands on your host (such as `wallabag:install`), you also should:

-   source the proper env files on your command line, so variables like `SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_HOST` will exist.
-   create a `127.0.0.1 rdbms` on your system `hosts` file

Run wallabag
------------

1.  Fork and clone the project
2.  Edit `app/config/parameters.yml` to replace `database_*` properties with commented ones (with values prefixed by `env.`)
3.  `composer install` the project dependencies
4.  `php bin/console wallabag:install` to create the schema
5.  `docker-compose up` to run the containers
6.  Finally, browse to <http://localhost:8080/> to find your freshly installed wallabag.

At various step, you'll probably run into UNIX permission problems, bad paths in generated cache, etcâ€¦ Operations like removing cache files or changing files owners might be frequently required, so don't be afraid !
