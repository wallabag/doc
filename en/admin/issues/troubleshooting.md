## Logs

In a standard wallabag installation the log level is set to *production* (or `error`) which means wallabag will only log errors. To find any issues you need to raise the `action_level` value of Monolog to `debug` instead of `error` in your `wallabag/app/config/config_prod.yml` file.

For JavaScript issues you will also need to view the javascript console of your browser. All major browsers have developer tools for viewing the console, and you usually access them by pressing F12.

{% hint style='info' %}
