# Migrate from ...

In wallabag 2.x, you can import data from:

-   [Pocket](Pocket.md)
-   [Readability](Readability.md)
-   [Instapaper](Instapaper.md)
-   [wallabag 1.x](wallabagv1.md)
-   [wallabag 2.x](wallabagv2.md)

We also developed [a script to execute migrations via command-line interface](#import-via-command-line-interface-cli).

Because imports can take ages, we developed an asynchronous tasks system. [You can read the documentation here](../../admin/asynchronous.md) (for experts).

# Import via command-line interface (CLI)
---------------------------------------

If you have a CLI access on your web server, you can execute this command to import your wallabag v1 export:

```bash
bin/console wallabag:import username ~/Downloads/wallabag-export-1-2016-04-05.json --env=prod
```

Please replace values:

-   `username` is the user's username
-   `~/Downloads/wallabag-export-1-2016-04-05.json` is the path of your wallabag v1 export

If you want to mark all these entries as read, you can add the `--markAsRead` option.

To import a wallabag v2 file, you need to add the option `--importer=v2`.

If you want to pass the user id of the user instead of it's username, add the option `--useUserId`.

You'll have this in return:

```
Start : 05-04-2016 11:36:07 ---
403 imported
0 already saved
End : 05-04-2016 11:36:09 ---
```
