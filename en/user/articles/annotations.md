# Annotate your articles

In each article you read, you can write annotations. It's easier to understand with some pictures.

Select the part of the article that you want to annotate and click on the pencil:

![Select your text](../../../img/user/annotations_1.png)

Then, write your annotation:

![Write your annotation](../../../img/user/annotations_2.png)

The text is now highlighted and you can read your annotation if you move the mouse cursor over it.

![Read your annotation](../../../img/user/annotations_3.png)

You can create as many annotations as you wish.
