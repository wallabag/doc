# Pocket

## Create a new application on Pocket

To import your data from Pocket, we use the Pocket API. You need to create a new application on their developer website to continue.

-   Create a new application [on the developer website](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new)
-   Fill in the required fields: application name, application description, permissions (only **retrieve**), platform (**web**), accept the terms of service and submit your new application

Pocket will give you a **Consumer Key** (for example, *49961-985e4b92fe21fe4c78d682c1*). You need to configure the `pocket_consumer_key` in the `Config` menu.

Now, all is fine to migrate from Pocket.

## Import your data into wallabag 2.x

Click on `Import` link in the menu, on `Import contents` in Pocket section and then on `Connect to Pocket and import data`.

You need to authorize wallabag to interact with your Pocket account. Your data will be imported. Data import can be a demanding process for your server.
